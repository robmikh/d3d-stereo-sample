# d3d-stereo-sample
This is a port of the original [Direct3D stereoscopic 3D sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Direct3D%20stereoscopic%203D%20sample) to C++/WinRT. There's still a lot of cleanup to be done, but it at least runs now. Although I have yet to test it on a stereo enabled machine...

To view the original README, please check the [Original.README.md](Original.README.md) file.

## Note about the license
While the original README lists the license as MS-LPL, the [repo the sample lives in uses the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/blob/master/LICENSE).
